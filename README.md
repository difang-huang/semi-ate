# The Semiparametric Estimation of Average Treatment Effect repository

This repository contains two different parts:
* In the Simulation folder repository, you can find the Matlab codes that generated all the simulation results in the paper.
* In the Empirical folder repository, you can find the datasets and Matlab codes that generated all the empirical results in the paper. The first empirical example uses data from the Almond et al. (2005) that analyze the average effect of maternal smoking on babies’ birth weight. The second empirical example uses data from the LaLonde (1986) that analyze the average effect of job training program on future earnings.
