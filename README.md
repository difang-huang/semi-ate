# Replication Code for "Robust Semiparametric Estimation of Average Treatment Effect"

In this folder, you can find the datasets and the Matlab codes that generated all the results in the paper "Robust Semiparametric Estimation of Average Treatment Effect". The code requires the Parallel Computing Toolbox from Matlab.

This repository contains two different parts:
* In the Simulation folder repository, you can find the Matlab codes that generated all the simulation results in the paper.
* In the Empirical folder repository, you can find the datasets and Matlab codes that generated all the empirical results in the paper. The first empirical example uses data from the Almond et al. (2005) that analyze the average effect of maternal smoking on babiesâ€™ birth weight. The second empirical example uses data from the LaLonde (1986) that analyze the average effect of job training program on future earnings.
